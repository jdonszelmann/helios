# helios
Helios programming language - similar to python and made (not a lot of) c++ code


 # done:
 - VM
 - variables
 - math expressions  
 - compilation (though it is primitive)
 - lexing (though it is primitive)

# in progress:
- [x] functions
- [ ] classes
- [x] standard library
- [ ] import system
_be sure to suggest more_

# examples of correct syntax
(be aware not everything is implemented YET)
```python
  a = 3
  b = 5
  c = (a + b)*2
  
  printhey = function():
    return("hey")
  
  printhey2 = function():
    execute("hey")
  
  if(c == 16):
    print("hey")
  
   else():
    print(printhey())
    printhey2():
      a = args()
      print(a[0])
```
